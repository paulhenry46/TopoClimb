## Usage Example

### For Mobile App Developers

```bash
# List all sites (no auth required)
curl https://your-site.com/api/v1/sites

# Get site details
curl https://your-site.com/api/v1/sites/1

# Get areas for a site
curl https://your-site.com/api/v1/sites/1/areas

# Get user profile (requires auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
